Q&A Bot
=======

This program implements a simple bot that can answer questions in a restricted English grammar using knowledge from wikidata.

Several helper functions have been provided, but the primary `answer` function needs an implementation.

Tests

python3 -m doctest qa.py
```

or:

```
make
```

Running
